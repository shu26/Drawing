# Drawing App  
This is a drawing app for the begineers, and this is not the original code.  
The original code is [here](https://github.com/anthrgrnwrld/drawWithExpand/tree/66fafc321ba11a57a8560a4149579dd6d8b25985).  
This converts the original code of Swift2.2 into the code of Swift5 and Xcode10.3.  
  
## Description  
  
You can draw pictures, change colors and pens, redo and undo, and save the picture.  
However, I had a mistake about the connection of the UI parts, so it does not work well about the change of pens.  
If you set any buttions on the view (not on the scrollView), everything may be ok.  
  
## Usage  
Clone this repo, using `git clone`, then you can use the main function of the Drawing App.
